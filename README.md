## Where's the Beef?

For this project, you helped a biological researcher named Roza in her interest on using an elusive bacterial species with the ability to 
synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza's laboratory collaborated with a food startup called "Improbable Beef" to study possible 
ways to create beef from certain bacteria species. Roza has hypothesized that this certain bacteria could possibly be found in a human 
navel. To test this hypothesis, Roza has sampled the belly buttons of people across the US to identify bacteria species that colonize our 
navels. This information is kept anonymous and each volunteer was assigned an ID number. This information was then used to create a web 
dashboard for researchers and the volunteers to go over the data in the form of various charts and panels. The first goal was to create the 
dashboard with the ability for someone to select a specific ID number out of a list and pull up demographic information on that specific 
volunteer.

## The Final Product:

Once that first goal had been accomplished and the groundwork laid, further assistance was required to help Roza in building out the rest 
of the dashboard. This was so that all of the data collected could be viewed by each volunteer ID number. There already was a completed 
panel for demographic information but the next step was to visualize the bacterial data of each volunteer. The end goal was that each 
volunteer should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef finds a species as a 
candidate to create synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is from their belly button. This 
information was displayed in a bar chart for the top 10 bacteria species per volunteer, a bubble chart to see bacteria cultures per sample 
and finally, a gauge for how many times each volunteer washed their navel in a week. The end product was then spruced up and hosted on 
GitHub Pages so that the dashboard could be easily accessed.
